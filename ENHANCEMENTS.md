# Blazor UI Enhancements

## Latest Updates (January 2025)

### Mobile Card Sizing and Layout Improvements üì±
Optimized card sizing at 50% scale with maintained text readability:
- **50% card scaling**: Cards reduced to exactly half size on mobile (100px ‚Üí 50px width, 140px ‚Üí 70px height)
- **Preserved text size**: Rank (1.4rem) and suit (1.1rem) text kept full-sized for excellent readability
- **Unified card dimensions**: All cards (stock, waste, foundations, tableau) consistent across game areas
- **CSS variable spacing**: Tableau card vertical spacing uses CSS variables for responsive adjustment (35px desktop ‚Üí 18px mobile)
- **Fixed foundation positioning**: Stock/waste area constrained to 106px width to prevent layout shift
- **Proportional spacing**: All gaps scaled proportionally (20px ‚Üí 10px ‚Üí 6px) for efficient mobile space use
- **Optimized UI elements**: Buttons, padding, and fonts adjusted for mobile screens

**Implementation Details:**
- Direct `.card` dimension modification in mobile media query (50% of desktop)
- Converted inline `margin-top` to CSS variable `--row-index` for responsive tableau spacing
- Fixed-width `.stock-waste-area` (106px = 50px + 6px + 50px) prevents foundation movement
- Waste card overlap proportionally adjusted (-60px ‚Üí -30px) for 50% sizing
- Foundations positioned with `flex: 1` and `justify-content: flex-end` for stability
- Comprehensive spacing optimization: buttons, padding, gaps all scaled appropriately

**Files Modified:**
- `game.css:166-534` - Card sizing, spacing variables, mobile responsive styles
- `GameBoard.razor:114` - CSS variable integration for tableau positioning
