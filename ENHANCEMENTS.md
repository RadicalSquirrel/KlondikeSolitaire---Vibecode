# Blazor UI Enhancements

## Latest Updates (January 2025)

### Unified Green Background üé®
Page-wide visual consistency:
- **Matching background**: Page background now uses the same green felt gradient as the game board
- **Seamless appearance**: Eliminates visual discontinuity outside the game area
- **Full viewport coverage**: min-height: 100vh ensures gradient covers entire screen

**Implementation:**
- Applied `linear-gradient(135deg, #1e5128 0%, #2d6a4f 100%)` to html/body elements
- Matches existing game board background for cohesive design

**File Modified:**
- `app.css:3-4` - Background gradient and viewport height

### Waste Reversal Option and UI Improvements üîÑ
New gameplay option and improved settings dialog UX:
- **Waste reversal on recycle**: Optional setting to reverse card order when recycling waste back to stock (default: off)
  - Fixes the backwards sorting behavior that occurred during stock recycling
  - Configurable via checkbox in game settings
  - Preserves traditional Klondike behavior by default
- **Improved settings dialog layout**: Start Game and Cancel buttons moved to top of dialog
  - Buttons now appear immediately below the header for better accessibility
  - Removed redundant bottom footer for cleaner interface
  - Actions are visible without scrolling on any screen size

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `ReverseWasteOnRecycle` boolean property to `GameOptions` (default: false)
- Modified `DrawFromStock()` to conditionally reverse waste pile when recycling to stock
- Restructured `GameSettings.razor` component with new `.settings-actions` section
- Settings option persisted across game sessions via existing settings mechanism

**Files Modified:**
- `GameOptions.cs:12` - New ReverseWasteOnRecycle property
- `KlondikeSolitaireGame.cs:91-103` - Conditional waste reversal logic
- `GameSettings.razor:10-13,70-75` - UI restructuring and new option

### Mobile Card Sizing and Layout Improvements üì±
Optimized card sizing with orientation-aware scaling and maintained text readability:
- **Portrait mode (50% scaling)**: Cards reduced to half size (100px ‚Üí 50px width, 70px ‚Üí 105px height)
  - Optimal for vertical space utilization on narrow screens
  - Compact layout allows full game visibility
- **Landscape mode (75% scaling)**: Cards increased to 75% of desktop size (100px ‚Üí 75px width, 140px ‚Üí 105px height)
  - Better visibility and usability when device is rotated horizontally
  - Takes advantage of wider viewport
  - More comfortable card manipulation in landscape orientation
- **Preserved text size**: Rank (1.4rem) and suit (1.1rem) text kept full-sized for excellent readability across all orientations
- **Unified card dimensions**: All cards (stock, waste, foundations, tableau) consistent across game areas
- **CSS variable spacing**: Tableau card vertical spacing uses CSS variables for responsive adjustment
  - Desktop: 35px, Portrait: 18px, Landscape: 26px
- **Orientation-specific layouts**:
  - Portrait: 106px stock-waste-area width, 6px gaps
  - Landscape: 158px stock-waste-area width, 8px gaps
- **Fixed foundation positioning**: Stock/waste area constrained to prevent layout shift in both orientations
- **Optimized UI elements**: Buttons, padding, and fonts adjusted per orientation

**Implementation Details:**
- Base mobile query `@media (max-width: 768px)` for portrait/default mobile
- Landscape override `@media (max-width: 768px) and (orientation: landscape)` for horizontal devices
- Direct `.card` dimension modification in media queries (50% portrait, 75% landscape)
- Converted inline `margin-top` to CSS variable `--row-index` for responsive tableau spacing
- Fixed-width `.stock-waste-area` prevents foundation movement (106px portrait, 158px landscape)
- Waste card overlap proportionally adjusted (-30px portrait, -45px landscape)
- Foundations positioned with `flex: 1` and `justify-content: flex-end` for stability
- Comprehensive spacing optimization across orientations

**Files Modified:**
- `game.css:166-626` - Card sizing, spacing variables, mobile responsive styles, landscape media query
- `GameBoard.razor:114` - CSS variable integration for tableau positioning
