# Blazor UI Enhancements

## Recent Updates

### 1. **Light Blue Card Highlighting** ✨
Selected cards now display with a beautiful light blue (#4dd0e1) highlighting:
- 4px cyan border with glowing shadow effect
- Subtle gradient overlay for better visibility
- Smooth animations when selecting/deselecting
- Works across all card locations (waste, foundations, tableau)

**Implementation:**
- Cards track their `IsHighlighted` state
- CSS applies `box-shadow` and gradient overlay
- Automatic clearing when making moves

### 2. **Error Messages for Invalid Moves** ⚠️
Contextual error messages now appear when invalid moves are attempted:

**Error Types:**
- **Foundation Errors**: "Cannot place this card on that foundation. Cards must be placed in ascending order by suit (Ace, 2, 3, ..., King)."
- **Empty Tableau Errors**: "Only Kings can be placed in empty tableau columns." (when King-only rule is active)
- **Alternating Color Errors**: "Cards must be placed in descending order with alternating colors (e.g., Red 7 on Black 8)."
- **Foundation→Tableau Errors**: "Cannot move card from foundation to tableau. Either the move is disabled in settings or the card placement is invalid."

**Features:**
- Animated slide-down entrance
- Warning icon with shake animation
- Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds
- Red gradient background with shadow
- Clears automatically on next valid action

**Implementation:**
- Error state tracked in `GameBoard` component
- Check move success/failure for all move types
- CSS animations for smooth UX

### 3. **Real-Time Timer Updates** ⏱️
The game timer now updates every second in real-time:

**Features:**
- Timer increments continuously during gameplay
- Updates every 1 second via `System.Threading.Timer`
- Pauses when game is won
- Displays in `mm:ss` format
- Properly disposed when component is destroyed

**Implementation:**
- Background timer thread updates `currentElapsedTime`
- Uses `InvokeAsync` to safely update UI from background thread
- Timer disposal in `Dispose()` method prevents memory leaks
