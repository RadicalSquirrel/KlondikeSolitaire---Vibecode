# i'm livid

Many, many Klondike Solitaire applications exist today, and they are all somehow objectively worse than traditional windows solitaire

## how did this happen?

I'm unsure since i'm no expert, but likely this is due to enshittification of all modern video games which the ad-centric internet has driven. Somehow, things without ads still don't have any sort of optionality for various rulesets

## this is what i did about it

i vibecoded a klondike solitaire app, and added pwa functionality to it with the intention of deploying it to github pages and using it on my phone. I'll likely add some minor functionality as time goes on, but it also has a console interface if anyones interested, because that's where i started when building it.

## license?

to be added, but fork it and change it as you see fit. don't put ads or sell it.
